Hi, i'm CodeX, just a kid who has too much time on his hands. I like to make offensive stuff e.g. droppers, keyloggers, C2 infra etc. Or do boxes when i'm bored. I also play 
CTFs with friends (surprised I have any). I made this git pages site just to put CTF solutions etc (sometimes bonus points are given for doing it) and occasionally some other
stuff my remaining braincell finds interesting. I would post HTB box solutions but I cant be bothered to remove active boxes from the site, so i'll stick to VulnHub boxes
for now. Feel free to look around my box!
